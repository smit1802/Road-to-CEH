Today I started again on the CEH Journey
I have started more seriously now, I have gone through some chapters since my last commit
but Now I have 18 days to open my college. so, I am planning to do some heavy work in this period.

What did I Learn today?

I noted down the important ports listed in the beginning.

started with port 53 - DNS Zone Transfer
DNS client and DNS server setup a connection to communicate.
The client sends the message over UDP.
if the size of the message is more than the default size then the message is truncated.
The client resends the message and the UDP fails again but this time the it uses TCP to send the message.
Malware is transfered over this port

NetBIOS uses 3 ports which are namely UDP 137, UDP 138, TCP 139
UDP 137 - NetBIOS name service
UDP 139 - NetBIOS session service

The Following tools are used for NetBIOS enumeration(You gotta google the tools as I cant list commands for them here):
-- nbstat
-- netbios-enumerator
-- namp (the god)
-- global network inventory
-- advanced IP Scanner
-- ns auditor
