I learned about the CIA triad that is confidentiality, integrity and availability.
There are 2 more things to be added to this that are authenticity and Non-repudiation

Authenticity refers to the characteristics of the communication and any type of data ensures the quality of being genuine

Non - repudiation : A guarantee that the sender cannot deny having sent the message and the receiver cannot deny having received the message

classification of attacks
there are 5 types of attack in total

the attack techniques like sql injection , xss , DDOS, Firewall, session hijacking
this type of attack is breaking into secure systems of the target.

this type of attack is not directly attacking the target systems. Using third party services to get as much as information about the target as possible
In this type of attack we do reconaissance on network activities using sniffers.
----footing
----sniffing and eavesdropping

-- close in attack
close in attacks are performed when the attacker is in close physical proximity with the target system or network.
the main goal of this attack is to gather or modify information or disrupt its access.
